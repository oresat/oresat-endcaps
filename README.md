# "End Cap" PCBs for OreSat

These are the "end cap" PCBs that attach to the +Z and -Z ends of the satellites. Mostly these are to protect the end cards from "space", as well as to hold the magnetometers (two per end cap) as far as away from ferrous stuff as possible. It's also a good place for backup antennas, specifically patch antennas (S band and L1).

## Features

- Cutouts for deployable antennas
- Double magnetometers.
- Single vertical 10mm tall 1.27 mm connector that plugs into the "end card" card.
    - On the End Cap:  Harwin M55-6001242R 12 pin female vertical connector 
    - On the End Card below: Harwin M55-7011242R 12 pin male vertical connector
- No available RF connectors.
